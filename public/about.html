      <p id="bodyp-1">I am currently a student at the University of California Irvine studying computer science where I fell in love with creating. I came into university with feeling miles behind my peers who seem to have been coding since they were born. On top of that, being a woman in the major has not been easy so if you would have told me that I'd be writing this text here on my website, I would never have believed you. My journey is still most definitely a work in progress but I strive everyday to fall down and get back up which is why in my spare time I like to participate in hackathons and start new projects. For this, I am fortunate to be surrounded by people who have helped me come this far. Thank you Mom and Dad.</p>
      <p id="bodyp-2">Growing up, I have always found solace in embracing my creative sides. I love to create and though programming is on the STEM side of things, it has actually allowed me to vastly expand my artistic tool box. Writing is also another one of my creative expressions. I grew up writing stories on Wattpad and am still an avid reader today. In my high school years, I was a journalist for a youth-run organization that advocates for affordability and accessibility of healthcare which I believe strongly in.</p>
